# Earthling Fortress
This mod add a new Civ and a new race for the Fortress Mod of Dwarf Fortress: the earthlings.
They're short-lived small humanoids, half the size of a dwarf and they live exclusively underground. They're fond of crafting and artwork. They rely on the inorganic slaves they create to do the manual work.

Features:
- Inorganic and tireless slaves
- Cave animals + 1 new : a powerful trainable elemental
- New positions
- New buildings
- New reactions : rock furnitures and tools, gargoyles crafting, elemental calling, rock weapon and armor crafting (as strong as copper gear), process new plants, craft explosive bolts
- Make wool from rock, rock and wood from plants
- Eat your enemies

Tips:
- Embark in a area with clay and sand available, because you need both for earth elemental summoning
- Buy some gargoyles and some rockshroom/woodshroom seeds at the embark screen
- Buy some wood logs also, because you'll have no axes available until you find one
- Gargoyle units have bonus in their caste, like Stone is a good miner and Clay is a good farmer
- Gargoyles can't heal by themselves, so you need earthlings to take care of them
- Earthlings can't stay too long aboveground, they mentally suffer from the sun
- The elves are a good source of wooden items on the early years of your fortress. Once you managed to get an axe (and wood logs), they become a great source of meat :)

Requiert DF 0.47 and dfhack
It should be compatible with anything, as long as you edit the onmapload.init file if already existing and conflicting with another of your mods
Don't use the manager to summon units, it doesn't seem to work properly :(
